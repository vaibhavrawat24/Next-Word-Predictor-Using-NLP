# About NLP :-
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that aims to make computers understand and interpret the written text as well as spoken human language in a similar way as humans do. NLP has undergone tremendous improvements due to the advancement in deep learning and neural networks in the past few years. It finds applications in text processing, machine translation, and speech recognition. However, due to the complexity and size of the language models, it becomes extremely difficult to deploy and run these models on mobile and other edge devices. This is due to the limited resources available when dealing with such devices. However, federated learning comes to the rescue in this scenario, providing the ability to train language models on the user device itself without compromising the usersâ€™ data privacy.

The medium_data.csv file is used for next word prediction for fetching data.

You can run the codes using google collab or in jupyter notebook.
